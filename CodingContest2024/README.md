# Coding Contest 2024 (April)

## Introduction

The Coding Contest is an event that takes place twice a year. It is hosted by the company Cloudflight. The idea is simple, coders get an input and have to process it like in the level description to get an output and proceed to the next level.

## Why use a Preset?

Using a preset gives you certain advantages. The parsing and processing of inputs gets way easier and you only have to worry about solving the problem.

## How to use this Preset?

1. Download this Preset
2. Open it in an IDE of your choice
3. Copy the input files into the ./Input/ folder
4. Write parser functions to process the input
5. Write a solution function to solve the problem
6. Run the program
7. Upload the output files in the ./Output/ folder
8. Same again in the next levels
